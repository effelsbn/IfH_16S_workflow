# IfH_16S_workflow
Here we deposit the code for our standard workflow for processing full-length 16S-amplicon sequencing.

## Mock control
We include a commercial mock community in all our runs as a positive control.
You can find the theoretical composition as well as instructions how to quantify biases at the [Zymo Research website](https://www.zymoresearch.de/products/zymobiomics-microbial-community-dna-standard).
